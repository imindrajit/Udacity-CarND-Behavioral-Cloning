# Udacity-CarND-Behavioral-Cloning

# About

This project is part of Udacity's Self-Driven Car Nanodegree Program. The car has to drive through by itself on a track from a video game. Convolutional Neural Networks have been used for predicting the steering angle for the car.

# Data Exploration

Udacity data has been used in this project. There is a file * data_exploration.ipynb * which shows information about the data provided. Also, a sample output of an input through the augmentation pipeline is provided in the same file.
